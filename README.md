## What is Musician Connect?
Musician Connect is an online platform to help people who are in need of skilled musicians connect with them. Musicians get to register for a public profile on the platform, where their skill set is on display for potential clients to see. Likewise, it will help clients who are in need of musical services easily find what they are looking for, as well as connect fellow musicians for social and developmental events. As a musician myself, I believe an application like this would be valuable to both musicians and clients. Because it provides a platform to showcase the musicians, while also making it easier for clients to access the unique services and talent of every musician around their city.

## Technologies
### Backend:
* Python
* Flask

### Database:
* MySQL
* SQLAlchemy

### Frontend:
* React
* JavaScript
* CSS/Bootstrap

## Alternative Options
## MySQL over SQLite:
MySQL is preferred over SQLite for a number of reasons, some of which are stated below:
### Scalability:
    MySQL is designed to handle large amounts of data and high traffic volume, making it a better choice for large-scale applications. SQLite, on the other hand, is best suited for smaller, less complex projects.
### Performance:
    MySQL is generally faster than SQLite when it comes to querying large amounts of data, thanks to its more advanced indexing and caching mechanisms.
### Security:
    MySQL offers more advanced security features, such as SSL encryption and user authentication options, making it a better choice for applications that require strong security measures.
### Cross-platform support:
    MySQL is available on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and various Unix systems, making it a more versatile choice than SQLite.
### Advanced functionality:
    MySQL offers more advanced functionality than SQLite, such as support for stored procedures, triggers, and views, which can make it easier to develop more complex applications.

## Python/Flask over Node/Express:
The decision to work with Python/Flask over Node/Express was based on considerations such as:
### Wider Range of Libraries:
    Python has a much larger library ecosystem than Node.js, which provides access to more tools and libraries for web development. Flask leverages these libraries, making it easier to build complex web applications.
### Mature and Stable:
    Python and Flask have been around for much longer than Node.js and Express, and as a result, they have a more stable and mature ecosystem. This means that they can be relied upon for stability and security over time.
### Large Community:
    Python has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources and support available for developers who are building applications with Flask. This community also contributes to the development of new tools and libraries that can be used with Flask.
### Better Scalability:
    Python is generally more scalable than Node.js, especially when it comes to handling large amounts of data or complex business logic. Flask provides a modular approach to building web applications, which makes it easier to scale the application over time.

## Challenge Statement
- **Easy Access to Musicians:**
There comes a time in every person’s life when there is cause for celebration. In moments like this, people want to hire musicians to help light up the event. Be it a single player, a band or an orchestra. This can be a bit of a hassle as most people don’t know where and how to find these musicians. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a platform, where potential clients can come to shop for their musical needs.

- **Provide Visibility for Musicians:**
There are a lot of wonderful musicians out there who desire to be hired to play at gigs and events but have no visibility to their potential clients. This platform will bridge the gap between musicians and their clients.

- **Find Music Tutors:**
This project will make finding a music coach for any instrument of choice a lot easier.
This project will be valuable to both musicians looking for clients and clients looking to hire professional musicians.

## Limitation
The scope of this project will be limited to musical services within Abuja, Nigeria for now. It is intended to expand into other services nationwide in the foreseeable future.
