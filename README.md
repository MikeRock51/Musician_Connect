# Musician Connect
### Bridging the gap between music professionals and their clients.


## What is Musician Connect?
Musician Connect is an online platform to help people who are in need of skilled musicians connect with them. Musicians get to register for a public profile on the platform, where their skill set is on display for potential clients to see. Likewise, it will help clients who are in need of musical services easily find what they are looking for, as well as connect fellow musicians for social and developmental events. As a musician myself, I believe an application like this would be valuable to both musicians and clients. Because it provides a platform to showcase the musicians, while also making it easier for clients to access the unique services and talent of every musician around their city.
